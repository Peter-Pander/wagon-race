# 🏎️ Wagon Race  

Welcome to **Wagon Race**, where speed, skill, and quick reflexes determine the ultimate champion! 🏁  

In this fast-paced showdown, two daring racers go **wheel to wheel**, battling for glory on the **dusty track**. Each player controls their wagon, pushing it forward with rapid key taps:  

- **Player 1:** Press `w` to move forward  
- **Player 2:** Press `p` to move forward  

Only the **swiftest** will reach the **finish line** first and claim victory!  

⚡ Think you have what it takes to be the fastest wagon racer? **Saddle up, hit the keys, and race to the win!** 🚀🔥
